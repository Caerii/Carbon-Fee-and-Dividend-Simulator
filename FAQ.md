### Core Policy Questions

**1. Is this just another regressive gas tax?**

No, it is the opposite of a regressive tax. While a gas tax simply takes money from consumers, a Carbon Fee & Dividend returns all of the net revenue directly to households. Because higher-income households have much larger carbon footprints (bigger homes, more travel), they pay more into the fund than they get back. As a result, economic models consistently show that **more than 70% of low- and middle-income families receive more in dividends than they pay in increased energy costs**, making them financially better off.

**2. How do we know this will actually reduce emissions?**

A rising, predictable fee on carbon is widely regarded by economists as the most effective, market-based tool for reducing emissions. By making pollution more expensive each year, it creates a powerful and consistent incentive for every business and individual to switch to cheaper, cleaner alternatives. This approach has worked successfully in places like British Columbia, which saw a 15% reduction in household fuel use after implementing a similar policy, all while their economy outperformed the rest of Canada.

**3. Won't this hurt Massachusetts businesses and make them uncompetitive?**

The policy is specifically designed to prevent this using a **Border Carbon Adjustment**.
*   **For Exporters:** Massachusetts companies that sell goods outside the state will receive a rebate for the carbon fees they paid, so their products remain competitively priced in other markets.
*   **For Importers:** A fee will be placed on carbon-intensive goods (like steel or cement) imported from states or countries that do not have a similar price on carbon.
This system protects local businesses from being undercut by outside polluters and encourages other jurisdictions to adopt their own climate policies.

**4. Why not just use regulations or subsidies instead?**

While regulations and subsidies for specific technologies are important, they can be slow, expensive, and often require the government to pick winners and losers. A Carbon Fee & Dividend is a more comprehensive and efficient solution because it:
*   **Covers the whole economy:** It sends a price signal to every sector, unlocking thousands of different solutions at once.
*   **Is revenue-neutral:** It doesn't grow government spending; it sends the money back to the people.
*   **Harnesses market forces:** It empowers businesses and consumers to find the fastest and most innovative ways to reduce their carbon footprint, rather than relying on a top-down mandate.

### Dividend & Financial Impact Questions

**5. How will people receive their dividend?**

The dividend will be delivered quarterly via direct deposit or check by the Department of Revenue. The system will leverage the same infrastructure already used to deliver other tax credits and state payments, ensuring it is efficient and reliable. To qualify, a person simply needs to have filed a state income tax return for the prior year or be enrolled in a state program like MassHealth.

**6. Will this dividend payment reduce my eligibility for other benefits (like SNAP or MassHealth)?**

No. The legislation explicitly states that the dividend **shall not be counted as income** for the purposes of determining eligibility for any means-tested state or federal assistance program.

**7. What is the Climate Prosperity Fund? Is that different from the dividend?**

The Climate Prosperity Fund (CPF) is an optional, long-term component of the policy designed to create permanent public wealth. A small portion of the carbon revenue is diverted into this fund, which is invested like the state pension fund.
*   **The Dividend** is the money paid out to households *this year* from *this year's* revenue.
*   **The Universal Carbon Income** is a smaller, permanent dividend that will be paid out to every resident from the CPF's investment earnings *in the future*.
This creates a lasting financial legacy for the Commonwealth, similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund, that will continue to benefit residents even after we have fully transitioned to a clean economy.

### Political & Practical Questions

**8. Has anything like this been tried before?**

Yes. As mentioned, a similar policy has been successfully operating in British Columbia, Canada, for over a decade. The core "fee-and-dividend" concept is also the basis for national climate policy proposals supported by economists and leaders across the political spectrum.

**9. Why should Massachusetts act on its own if the federal government hasn't?**

Massachusetts has always been a leader on major economic and social issues. By implementing a successful Carbon Fee & Dividend, we can create a proven, effective, and popular model for other states and the federal government to follow. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has its own legally binding emissions reduction targets, and this policy is the most cost-effective way to ensure we meet them.
