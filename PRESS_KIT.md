## **Press Release**

**Headline: Broad Coalition Launches Campaign for Carbon Fee & Dividend to Tackle Climate Change and Cut Costs for MA Families**

**BOSTON, MA** â€“ A diverse coalition of business, public health, faith, and community leaders today announced a major campaign to pass a Carbon Fee and Dividend in Massachusetts. The policy, detailed in the "Act to Accelerate Climate Affordability and Equity," aims to meet the Commonwealth's legally mandated 2030 climate targets while delivering quarterly dividend payments to every household.

The proposal places a steadily rising fee on carbon pollution and returns 100% of the net revenue directly to Massachusetts residents. This market-based mechanism is designed to lower greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of the economy while shielding low- and middle-income families from rising energy costs. Economic modeling shows over 70% of households would receive more in dividends than they pay in increased costs.

"This is the most efficient, effective, and equitable way to build a clean energy economy," said [Spokesperson Name], [Title]. "Instead of asking families to bear the cost of the energy transition, we are putting money directly in their pockets. It's a pro-growth, pro-family climate solution that will make Massachusetts a national leader."

The coalition is launching a statewide advocacy effort, including direct legislative outreach, grassroots organizing, and a public education campaign. They are urging lawmakers to co-sponsor the bill and bring it to a vote in the current session.

## **Quotes from Coalition Partners**

**[Name], MD, Massachusetts Medical Society:**
> "The health impacts of air pollution fall hardest on our most vulnerable communities. A fee on carbon pollution will mean fewer asthma attacks, fewer hospital visits, and healthier children across the Commonwealth. This is as much a public health bill as it is a climate bill."

**[Name], CEO of [A Clean Energy Company], member of NECEC:**
> "A predictable, rising carbon price provides the market certainty our industry needs to invest, innovate, and create thousands of good-paying local jobs. This policy unleashes the market to build a stronger, cleaner, and more competitive Massachusetts economy."

**[Name], Community Organizer, Alternatives for Community & Environment (ACE):**
> "For too long, environmental policies have failed to center the needs of frontline communities. By co-designing this policy with environmental justice leaders and including a robust dividend with a low-income bonus, this bill ensures that those hit first and worst by climate change will benefit first and most from its solutions."
