## Action 1: Find and Contact Your State Legislators

Your State Representative and State Senator are the most important people for you to contact. They are elected to represent you, and they track every call and email they receive from constituents.

**How to Find Them:**
1.  Go to the Massachusetts Legislature's search tool: [malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator](https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator)
2.  Enter your street address and city.
3.  The tool will show you your State Representative and State Senator, along with their phone numbers and email addresses.

## Action 2: Call Your Legislators (High Impact!)

A phone call is one of the most effective ways to get a legislator's attention. It's quick, easy, and shows you are an engaged constituent.

**Sample Script:**
> "Hello, my name is [Your Name] and I'm a constituent of [Legislator's Name] living in [Your Town/City].
>
> I'm calling to urge the [Representative/Senator] to **co-sponsor and support the Carbon Fee and Dividend Act.**
>
> This policy is a common-sense solution to lower emissions while tackling the high cost of energy. Returning the revenue as a dividend will put money directly back into our community and help my family.
>
> Thank you for your time and your service."

**Tips:**
*   Be polite and concise. You'll likely speak to a staff member, which is just as effective. They will tally your call.
*   If you're nervous, practice the script once before you call.
*   Leave a voicemail if no one answers! Be sure to include your name and address so they know you're a constituent.

## Action 3: Write a Personalized Email

An email allows you to go into a little more detail. Personalizing your message is key.

**Sample Template:**

**Subject:** Please Support the Carbon Fee & Dividend

**Body:**
> Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],
>
> My name is [Your Name], and I am a constituent writing from [Your Address] in [Your Town/City].
>
> I am writing to urge you to co-sponsor and support the Carbon Fee and Dividend Act.
>
> As someone who is concerned about [mention your personal reason, e.g., "the rising cost of heating my home," "the air quality in our community," "the future my children will inherit"], I believe this policy is the most effective and equitable solution.
>
> The dividend is especially important to me because [mention why the dividend matters to you, e.g., "it will help my family afford groceries," "it makes the policy fair for everyone"].
>
> Thank you for your leadership on this critical issue. I look forward to hearing about your position.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Your Name]

## Action 4: Write a Letter to the Editor (LTE) in Your Local Paper

LTEs are one of the most-read sections of any newspaper. They show the community and elected officials that there is broad support for an issue.

**Tips for Success:**
*   **Keep it short:** Most papers have a limit of 150-200 words.
*   **Reference a recent article:** Your chances of getting published are much higher if you are responding to a recent story about climate, energy prices, or the state budget.
*   **Make one clear point:** Focus on a single, powerful message (e.g., the dividend's fairness, the health benefits).
*   **Include your name and town:** Papers require this for verification.

**Sample LTE Template:**
> To the Editor,
>
> I was glad to see your recent article on [topic of recent article]. An effective solution that addresses both climate change and affordability is the Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal at the State House.
>
> By placing a fee on pollution and returning the money to every Massachusetts household, we can lower emissions while protecting family budgets. This isn't a gas tax; it's a dividend that puts money in our pockets. The policy is a win-win for our economy, our health, and our climate.
>
> I urge [Your Legislator's Name] to support this common-sense policy for the good of our community.
>
> [Your Name]
> [Your Town]
