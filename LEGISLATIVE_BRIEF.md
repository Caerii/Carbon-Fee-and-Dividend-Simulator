# The Massachusetts Carbon Fee & Dividend: A Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Climate Solution

**An Act to Accelerate Climate Affordability and Equity**

---

### The Challenge: Meeting Climate Targets While Ensuring Affordability

Massachusetts is legally bound to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030, but families across the Commonwealth are facing intense pressure from high and volatile energy prices. We need a policy that addresses both challenges simultaneously.

### The Solution: A Simple, Fair, and Market-Based Approach

A Carbon Fee and Dividend is the most efficient and equitable mechanism to achieve our climate goals. By placing a fee on carbon pollution and returning 100% of the net revenue to residents, we can drive down emissions while putting money directly into people's pockets.

### How It Works

1.  **Fee on Pollution:** A predictable fee is applied to fossil fuels at the first point of sale. The fee starts at **$30 per ton** of CO₂ in 2027 and rises by $10 each year, providing a clear market signal to invest in clean energy.

2.  **Return 100% of the Money to Households:** All net revenue is returned to every Massachusetts resident as a quarterly "Climate Dividend."
    *   **Year 1 Dividend (2027 estimate):** ~$190/adult, ~$95/child.
    *   **Low-Income Bonus:** Households with AGI ≤ 60% of state median receive a 30% bonus (~$247/adult).
    *   **Fairness:** Over 70% of low- and middle-income households will receive more in dividends than they pay in higher energy costs.

3.  **Protect MA Businesses:** A border adjustment mechanism rebates fees on exported goods and charges a fee on carbon-intensive imports, ensuring Massachusetts companies can compete on a level playing field.
