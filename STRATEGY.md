 # Strategic Partnership Plan: Scaling the Carbon Fee & Dividend in Massachusetts

This document outlines a strategic plan for building a broad, influential, and effective coalition to advocate for and successfully implement a Carbon Fee and Dividend policy in Massachusetts. The goal is to create a "strange-bedfellows" coalition that demonstrates overwhelming political, economic, and social support for the policy.

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **Shared Vision, Diverse Motivations:** We will unite groups around the central goal of passing the Carbon Fee & Dividend, while recognizing that each partner comes to the table with different primary motivations (e.g., climate action, public health, social justice, economic stability).
- **Mutual Benefit:** Partnerships must be built on trust and provide clear value to all parties involved. We will actively work to understand and support our partners' organizational goals.
- **Subsidiarity:** Empower local and grassroots organizations to lead in their communities, providing them with the resources, data, and support they need to be effective.
